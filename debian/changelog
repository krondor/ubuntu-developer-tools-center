ubuntu-developer-tools-center (0.1.1-0ubuntu1) vivid; urgency=medium

  * Bug-fix release as Google changed their android-studio checksum from
    md5sum to sha1sum. Implementing sha1sum largely thanks to Tin Tvrtković
    work!
  * Adapt tests + new tests for sha1sum.
  * Note that the new Android Studio doesn't ship the sdk with it anymore.
    You need to download it manually and set the path to it. Will try to
    get in touch with the android studio developer team for this.

  * Addition for the test jenkins server:
    - Add helper to display binary depends
    - Output xml tests and coverage report
    - Add xunit artefacts support in runtests
  * Some tests enhancement for working in the daily jenkins environment:
    - Change installing in conflict package prediction.
    - Give some time for the container in medium tests to start
    - Remove full install timeout logic. Instead, have a timeout if there
      is no new stdout/progress report change for a while. This ensure
      less flakyness in case of really slow network.
    - Remove on output testing first INFO message detection as it's a false
      positive.
  * No output by default when running tests:
    - Coverage tests doesn't print any stdout or logging info unless a tests
      is failing.
    - Debug profile is using the debug logging configuraiton as well.
    - Don't rely on importing tests/__init__.py to define logging format for
      nose.
    - Ensure subprocess (medium/large tests) set the same logging level as well.
    - Add a stdout hanlder in subprocess as well while testing (using
      the correct profile and be able to detect warning/errors)
  * debian/rules:
    - no need for --no-config for running tests anymore
  * Misc cleanups:
    - some refactoring of runtests
    - remove unusued imports
    - removed unused profile options
    - update documentation for the new logging profiles change.
  * Have pep8 tests passing on system version as well.
  * Add Spanish, Basque and Chinese (Hong Kong) translations. Thanks to all
    translators!

  * Enhance some tests by adding more info in case of failure and decouple
    some concerns.
  * Fix medium tests in using server name back as sbuild supports it again.
  * Refreshed certificates which expired and document how to get longer
    ones.
  * First trial to get medium tests running as autopkgtests, but disabled
    for now (Docker permission error inside the autopkg chroot)
  * Refactor i18n support with dropping babel and automatically run the
    commands when setuptools is building.
  * Add fr and zh_CN translations.

  * Fix coverage reports by importing tested modules only when needed and
    when overriding "packages" and "__files__", by reloading the module
  * Some cleanups (removed unused imports)
  * Add allow-stderr for adt tests: as nose-cov print some debug output
    at start which makes adt failing then. As we control,
    stderr and warnings during tests, disable this check.
